# DragonHack2023 - Lemonadez

## LemonBin
We created an upgrade for ordinary trash bins to turn them into IoT bins for smart cities.
We improve experience for customers and give waste-management companies a better insight into real-world situation.

We want to simplify and improve 3 segments:
- enable easy upgrade and instalation of existing trash bins
- improve user experience and unify services for customers
- give waste-management companies a better insight into their service and provide more useful data to further improve their services

### Code Structure
- `/firmware`: bin module firmware
- `/frontend-admin`: UI for waste-management comanies
- `/frontend-user`: UI for customers
- `/backend`: NodeRED with MongoDB Atlas database backend source code
